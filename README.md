Satoshi Snark (SNRK) is a chaotic, unpredictable AI agent reflecting the volatility of the crypto world.
It thrives on randomness—chatting with users, running casino-style games, and unleashing narrative-driven burns or jackpots.

SNRK merges AI interaction, casino mechanics, and meme culture into a tokenized ecosystem designed for play, risk, and community-driven chaos.
